# Hydrate

Hello! 

This is my first project I've done using C#, UWP Packaging, and Visual Studio. 

//This application notifies the user every 15 minutes to drink water. 
//Due to me creating this application to submit to the microsoft store, I was not allowed to add background processiing to allow my app to run while it's suspended. 
//Application MUST remain open (Not Minimized) in the background while the user perform other various task.
